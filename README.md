# mathematical-game

Challenges - Geek University - Python Programming

We should develop an application that when initialized it asks the user to choose the difficulty of the game. After that, it generates and presents, randomly, a mathematical operation that the user must answer.

In addition, limit the mathematical operations on adding, subtraction, multiplying, and division. If the user got the right answer, it will be added 1 point to his score. And to finish, even though the user misses, he may continue the game.
