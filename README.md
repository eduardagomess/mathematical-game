Challenges - Geek University - Python Programming

Develop an application whereupon initialization, ask the user to choose the level of difficulty of the game and after that generates and presents, at random, a calculation so that the user can inform the result.

Limit operations on adding, decreasing, multiplying and division. If the user gets the answer right, it will add 1 point to his score. Hit or miss, he may or may not continue the game.
